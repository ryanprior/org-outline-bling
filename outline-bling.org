#+TITLE: Outline Bling

* You used to call me
  1) On my cell phone
  2) Late night
  3) When you need my love

* I know when that #HotlineBling, that can only mean
  1) One thing

* Ever since I left the city you
** DONE Got a reputation for yourself now
  1) everybody knows
     - I feel left out
  2) Got me down (and I feel stressed out)
** STARTED Wearing less
** STARTED Going out more
** DONE (Having) glasses of champagne on the dance floor
** DONE Hangin’ with some girls I never seen before
** And me just don’t get along
** DONE Go places where you don’t belong
** DONE Got exactly what you asked for
** DONE Run out of pages in your passport

* These days
** TODO Wonder
   1) If you’re bending over backwards for someone else
   2) If you’re rolling backwoods for someone else
   3) Doing
      - Things I taught you
      - Getting nasty for someone else

* You don't need
  1) No one else
  2) Nobody else

* You
  1) Should just be yourself
  2) Right now you’re someone else
